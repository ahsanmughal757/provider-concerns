        <p>
          We often find that new clients are losing out on a lot of revenue
          because of aging accounts receivable (AR). Our approach to claim
          management includes strategies for tackling these old AR accounts and
          getting the most out of them. Sometimes, it's just a matter of
          figuring out what the outstanding balance is for and reaching out to
          the right party, whether it's the payer or the patient. As a physician
          billing firm, we aim to simplify the medical billing process, which
          means lower expenses and more money coming in.
