          Why Choose PCS as Your Physical Therapy Medical Billing Company?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Being a physical therapy medical billing company we completely realize
          how much complexities are faced in medical billing. Every payer has
          different billing criteria like different documentation patterns, time
          durations for claims submission pre-authorization criteria, etc. These
          various criteria for different payers make the billing process
          difficult and increase the chances of denials and rejections. PCS has
          a team of professionals who keep themselves updated with the latest
          policies of different payers and file the claims accordingly. Just
          outsource PCS and see your collections increasing.

          Simplifying Compliance for Physiotherapists
        </h2>
        <p>
          Most of the treatments provided by physiotherapists are recommended by
          doctors so these treatments cannot be changed following the insurer’s
          policies. This can raise a conflict between the provider and the
          insurer. But in the presence of our professional team, we provide you
          with different ways to get out of such a situation and minimize the
          disagreements between insurer and provider.

        </p>

        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">Scheduling Problems</h3>
        <p>
          As physical therapy is a referral-based therapy, so most of the
          patients in this case are from out-of-network offices. As setting an
          appointment and finding insurance coverage is included in the initial
          stages of the medical billing so finding a correct insurer is very
          important. With our latest cutting-edge physical therapy medical
          billing software, we provide all the necessary data to stay on top.

        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">Claim Denials</h3>
        <p>
          Denials and rejections have always been a large hurdle in maximizing
          the collections and these denials can occur even due to a small error.
          Also sometimes when it becomes difficult for the insurers to find out
          the insurance that covers the claim it increases the chances of
          denials by filing a claim to the wrong payer. PCS reduces the errors
          in billing and increases your payments successfully.
        </p>

        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">Coding Errors</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the claims are denied just due to errors in coding. Unlike
          other practices coding in the physical therapy field is a bit
          different and it requires modifiers. This thing requires medical
          billers and coders who are professional and experienced in their
          field. Contact PCS today for efficient coding and billing services.
